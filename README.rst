Facebook Exporter is a Facebook_ application that allows you to export
all[#] of the notes, status messages, and links that you have posted to
Facebook.  You may want to do this for archival purposes or to move the
content to another site or service.

You can access the `application on Facebook`_ if you want to export your
own data.

The code for Facebook Exporter is available on our `Github site`_.  The
code is written for use on `Google App Engine`_ (GAE); in order to provide your
own version of the application you would need to create a GAE account and
install the SDK on your development system.
